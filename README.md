# thepholio-desktop

**ThePholio Desktop** aims to be(come) a cross-platform file manager with an emphasis on image viewing and management.
Maybe one day it will turn into a digital asset management application (most likely not but... let's see how far this
goes :) ).

## Why would I start writing such a thing?

## Why would anyone use it?

## Some notable(?) features

## Supported formats

## TODO (in no particular order)
 - add directory selection capability
 - add fit / zoom / resize / full size capabilities
 - add generic error notification / reporting system
 - add extra basic metadata to the status bar (or somewhere else), especially DPI or similar
 - create a [material design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html)-based theme
